# TFTP_Project  

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simple, lightweight file transfer protocol used for transferring files over a network. It operates on the principle of UDP (User Datagram Protocol), making it faster but less reliable than more complex protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Here are some key characteristics and uses of TFTP

Step-By-Step Instruction to sucessfully run the Server and the Client.

Directory Tree <br/>
```bash
/css432-TFTP_Project (root directory)
    |--tftp 
        |-- makefile
            |--makefile
            |--/client
                |--tftp_client.c
                |--makefile
            |--/common
                |--tftp.h
                |--tftp.c
                |--makefile
            |--/server
                |--tftp_server.c
                |--makefile
```

1. If you are connecting on two different machines which have different IP address
    1. Open the tftp.h file present in the common folder
    2. Change the "SERV_HOST_ADDR" value to your server IP address
2. How to compile the program
    1. Go to makefile directory where the "client", "server", "common" and makefile files are present
    2. Run "make" in the linux command line 
3. How to run the program
    1. Server:  <br/>
       Run "./server" in the "server" directory <br/>
       It will run with a default port# 61124  <br/>
       ---Option--- <br/>
       You can give an option "-p Port#" if you want the server to listen on a specific port number <br/>
       Eg)```$./server -p 12345 ```  <br/>
    2. Client: <br/>
       Your client takes two arguments.  <br/>
       The first indicates whether it is read (-r) or write (-w) opteration  <br/>
       The second is a name of text file to be read or written  <br/>
       Run "./client -r filename.txt or ./client -w filename.txt" <br/>
       It will run with a default server port# 61124 <br/> 
       ---Option--- <br/>
       If you gave a specific Port# to Server, you also must give an option "-p Port#" with the same server Port# <br/>
       Eg)```$./client -p 12345 -r hello.txt ``` or ```$./client -p 12345 -w hello.txt ```

   # Challenge
   We spent the longest time to complete Step 5. After creating a new thread to handle multiple
   clients simultaneously, the logic handling packet loss that worked well before started to make
   bugs. The main reason was SIGALRM, which is needed to handle timeouts, doesnâ€™t go to a
   sub-thread. The system call only goes to the main thread if we take extra action for it. We solved
   this problem by using a signal mask. By blocking the main thread to receive SIGALRM and
   setting only a sub-thread to receive it from the kernel, we could make timeouts work well.
